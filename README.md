# Java Math Library

## Overview

This Java Math Library provides a set of classes for fundamental mathematical operations, particularly focusing on linear algebra and 2D geometry. The library includes classes for coordinates, matrices, vectors, and points, facilitating mathematical computations in a variety of applications.

## File Hierarchy

- **Coordinate:** Class for representing coordinates in mathematical spaces.

- **LinearAlgebra:** Abstract class serving as the foundation for linear algebra operations.

- **Matrix:** Class for matrix operations.

- **MatrixGeo:** Interface defining geometric operations for matrices.

- **Point:** Class representing points in mathematical spaces.

- **TwoDLib:** Class for 2D geometry operations.

- **Vector:** Class for vector operations.

- **VectorGeo:** Interface defining geometric operations for vectors.

## Usage

To use this library in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaMathLibrary.git
   ```
   
2. Import the necessary classes into your project:
    ```java
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.Coordinate;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.LinearAlgebra;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.Matrix;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.MatrixGeo;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.Point;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.TwoDLib;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.Vector;
    import com.yourcompany.mathlibrary.VectorGeo;
    ```
3. Utilize the classes and methods based on your mathematical requirements.

## Examples
### Matrix Operations
```java
Matrix matrixA = new Matrix(3, 3);
Matrix matrixB = new Matrix(3, 3);

// Populate matrices with values
// ...

// Matrix addition
Matrix result = matrixA.add(matrixB);

// Matrix multiplication
Matrix product = matrixA.multiply(matrixB);
```
### 2D Geometry
```java
Point pointA = new Point(2, 3);
Point pointB = new Point(5, 7);

// Distance between two points
double distance = TwoDLib.distanceBetweenPoints(pointA, pointB);
```
